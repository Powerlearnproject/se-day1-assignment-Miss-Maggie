#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the application of engineering used to design, develop, test and maintain software.
Importance:-
- Improves software reliability by ensuring that tasks are performed without bias.
- Boosts efficiency by optimizing workflow with high quality standards
- Ensures data security through encryption and aunthentication to enhance sensitive data protection.
- Improves scalability so that the system can handle large amounts of global tasks well.
- Enables powerful innovations and advancement in technology like the self-driven cars.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
- Mastering complexity - this involves building complex systems creating better documentation and maintainable data modules.
- Mastering process - this involves applying methods to efficiently develop and maintain high quality software by following a systematic approach.
- Mastering machine -this involves exploiting computing power through automation, optimization and decision making.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
- Planning - this involves identifying the software requirements and the scope.
- Requirement analysis - this involves understanding the user needs.
- System design - this involves planning the framework/architecture.
- Implementation/coding - this involves writing a clean code.
- Testing and debbugging - this involves examining the software and ensuring it works correctly without bugs.
- Deploymet - this is where you give out the software to the end users.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
- Waterfall methodology - this is a linear and structured model approach to software development. for example, healthcare industry projects for documentation is really critical.
- Agile methodology - this is a flexible and increamental approach to software development that ecourages collaboration. for example Mobile apps which needs frequent updates.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer - a professional who is responsible for developing, coding, testing  and maintaining applications.
Roles -
- Analysing user requirements.
- Designing software 
- Deploying and maintaining software
- Updating and communicating to functional teams about the software development.

Quality Assurance Engineer - a personel that ensures that applications are reliable, secure and meet user requirements through process improvement.
Roles -
- Defining expected outcomes for each test scenario
- Creating development standards and procedures for the programmers to follow.
- Executing automation scripts to check software stability 
- Monitoring and maintaining software after release.

Project Manager - responsible for planning, executing and overseeing software development projects.
Roles - 
- Planning and defining project goals, timelines and budgets
- Optimizing resource utilization 
- Creatin blueprint for the project.
- Tracking and communicating information regarding the project milestone.
- Deliver the complete software to the client and regularly check its performance.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs- a software application that provides coding, debugging, testing and deployment tools making development more efficient. e.g VScode
Importance:-
- They increase productivity and efficiency through code autocompletion, syntax highlighting and quick navigation.
- Compiles or converts the code into a simplified language that the operating system can understand.
- Helps in faster debugging and error detection.
- Supports multiple programming language and plugin extensions.

VCS - software tools that help developers to manage on codes over time. e.g Git
Importance :-
- Enables collaboration i.e multiple developers can work on same project without coflicts.
- Tracks changes over time - records detailed history of changes.
- Prevents data loss since code is backed up in repositories
- Branching and merging - supports creating branches for new features and merging them back into the main code.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
- Time Constraints - Solution - adopt agile methodologies, such as Scrum, to streamline workflows by dividing large projects into manageable sprints
- Software Security - Solution - research ways to defend against hacking, malware, phishing, insider and third-party threats.
- Software Accessibility and Usability - Solution - Use scalable architecture, Emphasize reliability.
- Changing Software Requirements - Solution - engineers can adopt approaches like agile development, which emphasizes iterative progress and adaptability, and modular design, which enables flexibility by breaking systems into manageable, independent.
- Rapid technological advancement - Solution -adopting continuous learning practices and using agile methodologies to adapt to emerging trends, keeping their skills sharp in an ever-evolving industry. 

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
- Unit Testing - tests individual components or modules of the software.
Importance -  helps to reduce future cost.
- Integration testing - verifys that different modules work together correctly 
Importance - prevents system failure
- System testing - tests entire syystem as a whole.
Importance - It help to verify that the system meets all functional and non-functional requirements, including performance, usability, and security.
- Acceptance testing - Tests thet verify that the system satifies the end user.
Importance - Ensures the software meets real-world user expectations.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering
Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering - is the process where you guide generative AI solutions to generate desired accurate, relevant and high quality outputs.
Importance -
- Improved user experience - By reducing biases
- Increased flexibility -  A prompt engineer can create prompts with domain-neutral instructions highlighting logical links and broad patterns
- Developer control - Effective prompts provide intent and establish context to the large language models

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague - Explain machine learning.
Improved - Explain machie learning in simple terms fo a beginner. Include an example of how it's used in recommendation systems lke Netflix or Youtube.
Improved propmt leads to clear, specific and concise responses making AI more useful and efficient. in this case it provides context making response pratical and rlatable.
